## Key points

1. Difficulty in confining hihg-energy electrons and positrons within ~20 pc regions of the ISM
2. The phase space of solutions for anisotropic diffusion is very small and they are unable to simultaneously explain the size and approximate radial symmetry of the TeV halo population
3. Properties of TeV Halos
   1. Hard gamma-ray spectrum --> IC scattering
   2. Roughly spherically symmetric emission
   3. Coincidence with young and middle-aged pulsars
   4. Diffusive particle propagation that extends out to ~ 10-50 pc
4. Are TeV halos produced in peculiar regions of the ISM that have preexisting condictions? -> Inconsistent with local and global observations
5. Are TeV halos produced throughout the bulk of the ISM and powered by the natal SNR, PWN or potentially a supergian star whihc produces a local environment necessary for halo formation?
6. They assume the anisotropic model and numerically solve the transport equation for a Geminga-like TeV halo for "standard" values of the magnetic field and another parameters.
7. The simulations also consider the diffusion tensor and the inclination angle. The anisotropic difussion model considers that the diffusion occurs along cylinder oriented in the LOS of the observer
8. They found that the parameter range allowed from the simulations is too small, $M_{A} = \delta B/B_{0} < 0.5$ and $\psi_{incl} < 5$ degrees
9. Observations of suppressed and spherically symmetric diffusion provide further credence in favor of models where the diffusivity is reduced not due to a geometrical effect but rather intrinsically inhibited/subdominant due to subtle mechanisms, either generated by the compact object or preexisting in the region
