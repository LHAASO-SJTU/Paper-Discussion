## Key points or summary

1. This is a brief review about the origin an dobservations of SNRs in gamma-rays
2. Diffusive shock acceleration
3. SNRs are grouped at least in two classes: Young SNRs and interating SNRs (SNRs surrounded by Molecular Clouds)
4. For young SNRs, the gamma-ray emission comes from the Shell region, and the emission is well explained by IC.
5. For interacting SNRs, the gamma-ray emission comes from dense regions in contact with the SNR itself. Here, the origin is most likely to be hadronic
6. Some SNR are reviewed, observations and features:
   1. Cas A
   2. Tycho SNR
   3. G 106.3+02.7
   4. RX J1713.7-3946
   5. IC 443
   6. W 44
   7. Gamma cygni
   8. W 28
7. Open question: Maximum energy at which SNRs can accelerate particles
8. Open question: The observed spectrum extends beyoind 100 TeV, however the SNRs represent a minority of LHAASO sources and gamma-ray SNRs
9. Open question: It is still unclear whether or no their contribution to galactic CR acceleration is dominant compared to other sources
