## Key points

- From a 3D model for distribution of matter and assuming that sources of UHECR are transient, the authors constrain parameters associated with the rate of burst and the turbulence scale within the local volume up to 300 Mpc.
- They found evidence that the excess (anisotropy) observed by Auger and Telescope array correlates with galaxies, in particular with Cen and UMa.
- One of the conclusions is that the UHECR sources are consistent with transient sources of stellar origin, rather than of galaxy origin.
