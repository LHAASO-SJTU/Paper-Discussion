## Key points

1. Long-duration GRB230307A is associated with a Kilonova, likely the progenitor is a compact-object merger
2. The evidence points to a magnetar as the central engine
3. Using a magnetar emission model, the authors estimate the X-ray emission and fit the data
4. Free parameters in the model are $(L_0,n,\tau)$ [Initial Luminosity of EM dipole torque, braking index, spin-down time scale]
5. They found that $\Gamma_\text{sat}$ values in the range $10^3,10^4$ can explain the observed X-ray emission, supporting the idea that the central engine is a magnetar
6. Follow-up paper: Unified model for compact-object mergers as progenitors for long- and short-duration GRBs

## Some questions

1. What is the breakup spin-period limit?
2. What is the saturation radius?
