## Key points

1. In the context of Vaccume Retarded Dipole (VRD) pulsar magnetic field, and assuming different emission geometries, the authors made a comparison of the light-curves obtained from Fermi and radio observations with those obtained from population synthesis. The goal is to find what emission geometry explains better the observations.
2. They generate the light curves for Polar Cap, Slot Gap, Outer Gap, One pole Caustic and radio core + cone emission geometries
3. The light curves for gamma-ray pulsars are taken from the 2-Fermi Pulsar Catalog for energies above 100 MeV, and radio data from telescopes in association with Fermi Pulsar Search and Timing Consortiums
4. Observed and simulated light curves are classified according to some characteristics as number of peaks, number of minima, number of phase windows, peak FWHM and width of the base of the peak.
5. Application of wavelet transform + iterative thresholding to smooth and remove noise in observed LCs
6. Simulated LCs are generated from population synthesis simulations using the geometrical model from Dyks+ 2004.
7. They construct the distributions for $\gamma$-ray and radio peak separation and radio lag distribution as a function of spin period, spin-down power, $\alpha$, the angle between rotation axis and direction of the observer, and the $\gamma$-ray flux beaming.
8. They found that none of the proposed emission geometries fully describe all the different morphologies of the observed LCs.
9. They also found evidence that the $\gamma$-ray peak multiplicity changes from RQ to RL pulsars, and that this effect is not explained by the emission geometries used in the study.
10. However, a combination of SG and OPC explain the observations in a complementary way, but more information is needed.
11. Finally, some of the distributions have strong dependence in the magnetosphere structure and also in the pulsar magnetic field. This means that some emmission geometries would change the morphology of the LCs when considering magnetic field configuration with infinity conductivity, for example (FEE magnetic field model)
