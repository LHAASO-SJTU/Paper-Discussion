# LHAASO SJTU Group

> This repository is used for paper reading. You can add a new paper of interest with title \[paper title\]\(link\). 
> To discuss a paper in group meeting, a special label can be set. Modify the contents of the `README.md` file to update the list of papers. Alternatively, you can add a small subpage in the `paper-summaries` directory and make a small summary about the highlights of the article.
