# Title: Diffuse Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emission From TeV Halos

Paper: [Diffuse Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emission From TeV Halos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00051)

# Summary:
> * The authors perform MC simulations to argue that the excess of diffuse gamma-ray emission measured by LHAASO's KM2A detector is due to the presence of unresolved TeV halos.
> * The MC simulations are conducted using parameters from mid-aged pulsars.
