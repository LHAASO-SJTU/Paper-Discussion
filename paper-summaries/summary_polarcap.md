## Key points

1. Pair cascades in polar caps are assection in models of coherent radio emissions of pulsars
2. Emission occurs from discahrges in quasi-periodic sparks
3. But, it is unclear where the radio emission originates
4. Cascades, coherent emission and discharges depend on the properties of the magnetosphere and plasma on the polar cap
5. The authors used 2D PIC simulation to describe the Poynting flux on the polar cap.
6. They found that it is possible to find transport channels of high-intensity Poyinting flux along magnetic fields
7. Current of the magnetosphere tends to zero in this transport channels
8. Here, the parallel component of the poynting flux is transport away from the pulsar and scape the magnetosphere as coherent radio waves
9. They conclude that conversion from particle to waves (density energy) is not needed to explain the coherent radio emission, and this emission is only generated from the elctric field on the gap, escaping along open magnetic lines in which no pair electron/positron creation occurs.
